//! Custom implementation of [`std::io::Cursor`] which uses a conservative growth strategy
//! when writing to the underlying vec. This is needed because the default Cursor uses a
//! [`Vec::reserve`] call which uses a doubling strategy. This can lead to excessive memory usage
//! for inverted index leafs with a small number of documents and therefore a small buffer inside
//! [`crate::IndexBlock`]s. This is common for text indexes where many terms are rare and only appear in a
//! few documents.
//!
//! This implementation uses a [`Vec::reserve_exact`] call to only allocate the exact amount of memory
//! needed to write the data. This can lead to more frequent allocations, but avoids the excessive
//! memory usage caused by the doubling strategy. There is a `CHANGED` comment to mark this section.
//!
//! The rest of this code is a verbatim copy of the [`std::io::Cursor`] implementation.
